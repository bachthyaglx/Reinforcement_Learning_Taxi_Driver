# Reinforcement_Learning_Taxi_Driver
The Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach using Q-learning algorithms to train an agent that can autonomously navigate the Taxi environment, demonstrating improved decision-making and task efficiency over time. The effectiveness of the learned policy is assessed through training and testing outcomes. Below are short summarizes from the outcomes of using RL in the Taxi driver application:

<b>Random Agent Simulation:</b>
   + Outcome: The agent takes random actions, resulting in unpredictable and often inefficient behavior.
   + Observation: Cumulative reward is low, and the agent frequently fails drop-offs.

<b>Testing the Trained Policy:</b>
   + Outcome: The trained agent applies its learned policy to the task.
   + Observation: The agent's behavior is more structured, and cumulative reward is expected to be higher than during random exploration.

<b>Performance Evaluation:</b>
   + Outcome: The final trained policy is evaluated based on the number of epochs and failed drop-offs.
   + Observation: The goal is to achieve a policy that minimizes the number of epochs and failed drop-offs, indicating efficient navigation and successful task completion.

<b>Results of Trained Policy:</b>
   + Outcome: The script generates a gif animation of the agent's interactions after training.
   + Observation: The gif visually summarizes the trained agent's behavior and performance in the environment.
