# Reinforcement_Learning_Taxi_Driver
The Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach using Q-learning aims to train an agent that can autonomously navigate the Taxi-v3 environment, demonstrating improved decision-making and task efficiency over time. The effectiveness of the learned policy is assessed through training and testing outcomes. Below are short summarizes from the outcomes of using RL in the Taxi driver application:

Random Agent Simulation:
   + Outcome: The agent takes random actions, resulting in unpredictable and often inefficient behavior.
   + Observation: Cumulative reward is low, and the agent frequently fails drop-offs.

Q-learning Training:
   + Outcome: The Q-learning algorithm updates Q-values based on experiences, aiming to learn an optimal policy.
   + Observation: The agent gradually improves its decision-making, and cumulative reward tends to increase over episodes.

Testing the Trained Policy:
   + Outcome: The trained agent applies its learned policy to the task.
   + Observation: The agent's behavior is more structured, and cumulative reward is expected to be higher than during random exploration.

Training and Convergence Analysis:
   + Outcome: The training process is monitored, and convergence analysis is performed.
   + Observation: Cumulative reward and the number of epochs per episode are observed to assess the learning progress over episodes.

Visualization and Animation:
   + Outcome: The script provides visualizations and animations of the agent's interactions with the environment.
   + Observation: Animated frames and console output help in understanding the agent's behavior and the learning process.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
   + Outcome: Hyperparameters like learning rate, discount rate, and exploration rate are tuned.
   + Observation: Adjusting hyperparameters impacts the learning speed and the quality of the learned policy.

Performance Evaluation:
   + Outcome: The final trained policy is evaluated based on the number of epochs and failed drop-offs.
   + Observation: The goal is to achieve a policy that minimizes the number of epochs and failed drop-offs, indicating efficient navigation and successful task completion.

Gif Animation of Trained Policy:
   + Outcome: The script generates a gif animation of the agent's interactions after training.
   + Observation: The gif visually summarizes the trained agent's behavior and performance in the environment.
